# RegexCrosswordGenerator

This is some relatively simple code to generate 
a Regex Crossword when given the desired solution.

`ClueGeneatorOptionPairs` is the most basic method of 
generating puzzles. Each cell is specified by the
two options of letters in the row and 
column clues.

`ClueGeneratorSeries` incorporates a 
series of letters into each row clue. The column
clues are bland by comparison.
